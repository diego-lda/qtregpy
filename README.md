# gtregpy

This package provides the software tools to implement Gaussian Transform Regression introduced in 
[Spady and Stouli (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06416.pdf).

With the tools in this package it is possible to obtain inference and estimation results for conditional distribution, 
quantile and density functions implied by flexible Gaussian representations.

For further details, please refer to the original text.

## Installation

You can install gtregpy with pip:

`pip install git+https://github.com/diego-lda/gtregpy.git`

Hopefully, in the near future we will upload it to PyPI and you can use:

`pip install gtregpy`


## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use gtregpy:
