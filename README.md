# gtregpy

This package provides the software tools to implement Gaussian Transform Regression introduced in 
“Gaussian transforms modeling and the estimation of distributional regression functions” Spady and Stouli (2020).

With the tools in this package it is possible to obtain inference and estimation results for conditional distribution, 
quantile and density functions implied by flexible Gaussian representations.
